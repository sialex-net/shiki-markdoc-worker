# Shiki syntax highlighting on Cloudflare Workers platform

An edge implementation of Shiki syntax highlighting, made with:

- Shiki JavaScript Engine
- Markdoc
- React Router 7
- Cloudflare Workers

This project has two main pieces:

- Service worker providing on-demand syntax highlighting (this repo)
- Client app ([sialex-net/shiki-markdoc-app](https://github.com/sialex-net/shiki-markdoc-app))

They are connected by [service binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```
